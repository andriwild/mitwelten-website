<p class="text-center">
Biodiversity is a cornerstone of resilient and thriving ecosystems, essential for maintaining ecological balance and supporting life on Earth. To effectively preserve and promote biodiversity, it is crucial to employ diverse and innovative strategies. This section delves into four key approaches: Citizen Science-based Ecosystem Studies, which empower individuals to contribute to scientific research and data collection; Communication Media, which play a vital role in raising awareness and disseminating information about biodiversity; Interspecies Platforms, which integrate the needs of various non-human species into urban and natural environments; and Participatory Installations, which engage communities in creating interactive and supportive habitats. Together, these approaches foster a collaborative and informed effort to sustain and enrich the natural world.

    text="Open space design is currently undergoing a reorientation: while evaluation criteria such as functionality, materiality, feasibility, quality and aesthetics have so far been geared exclusively to people, animals and plants are increasingly being included in the design process and nature conservation measures are not only understood as negative restrictions."

    text="Based on our IoT Toolkit, we experimented with different forms of displaying  sensor-measured data sets with multimedia features to create an informed responsive environment. New Media Art was relevant to this because it often pursues strategies in which data sets are prepared and reformatted in such a way that they can become more accessible to the public."
