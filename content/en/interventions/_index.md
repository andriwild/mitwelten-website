    text="One research approach in the Mitwelten project was based on natural science principles. By monitoring the ecosystems of the three field studies, we wanted to gain insight into the quality of biodiversity in the (peri-)urban habitats."

    text="As part of the Mitwelten research project, we developed a set of media formats for communicating research results. The aim was to sensitize the public to local ecosystems and their unspectacular but ecologically important more-than-human inhabitants."

    text="Based on our IoT Toolkit, we experimented with different forms of displaying  sensor-measured data sets with multimedia features to create an informed responsive environment. New Media Art was relevant to this because it often pursues strategies in which data sets are prepared and reformatted in such a way that they can become more accessible to the public."
