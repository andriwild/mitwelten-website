Open space design is currently undergoing a reorientation: while evaluation criteria such as functionality, materiality, feasibility, quality and aesthetics have so far been geared exclusively to people, animals and plants are increasingly being included in the design process and nature conservation measures are not only understood as negative restrictions. Concepts and methods like ‘Habitectures’ (MacKinnon 2014) and 'Animal Aided Design' (Weisser/Hauck, 2017) show how animals can be creatively integrated into the planning process and how their ecosystem services can be taken into account. The first step in implementing the design is to collect information about the occurrence, behavior and needs of the living beings to be integrated, in order to create the basis for the integration into the design process.
The promotion of biodiversity is based on the fact that all life forms have a fundamental right to exist, but in the long term it is also essential for the human species. In addition to knowledge or labor (human capital) or physical capital (e.g. machinery, production facilities), the economy also speaks of natural capital, i.e. the economic value of a landscape area, of which biodiversity is a central component.

As part of teaching units, we analyzed two campuses of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts FHNW and designed different multi-species infrastructures and furnishings.
