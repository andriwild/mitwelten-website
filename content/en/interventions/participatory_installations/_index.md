Based on our IoT Toolkit, we experimented with different forms of displaying  sensor-measured data sets with multimedia features to create an informed responsive environment. New Media Art was relevant to this because it often pursues strategies in which data sets are prepared and reformatted in such a way that they can become more accessible to the public. Also, the term Ambient Information Systems should be mentioned here, since it describes physical, tangible representations of information in the environment. By extending the IoT Toolkit with new actuator nodes for light (color LED lamps), sound (bluetooth speakers) and a physical animation (direction indicator), we developed participative and guiding concepts for open spaces. The actuators transfer sensor values back into the physical environment in a dynamic-regulatory manner and thus contribute to the design of an environment with a certain autonomous agency.
