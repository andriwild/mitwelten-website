As part of the Mitwelten research project, we developed a set of media formats for communicating research results. The aim was to sensitize the public to local ecosystems and their unspectacular but ecologically important more-than-human inhabitants. From a technological point of view, it was important that the mediation approaches were based as much as possible on the project's data sets and findings and that they had direct access to the research database. In this sense, the media applications are output channels of the IoT Toolkit and should be generically applicable for other locations and research projects. We developed and investigated the following four different media approaches:

- Discover: an atlas-like, map-based information display with selection and filtering functions
- WildCam TV: a cinematic image sequencer
- WalkApp: a GPS-based, context-aware web app
- Panorama: an interactive 3D image-based approach

__Situation and ecological challenge__

During the project, a significant amount of data was collected and analyzed using the Explore application to gain scientific insights. However, the aim was also to prepare the examined data and findings for the public and to make them accessible online.

__Media-ecological approach__

As a starting point, we decided on a map-based approach, where the data sets and results can be accessed in graphical visualizations in the geographical context. The research project involved quantitative measurements and qualitative surveys such as interviews and questionnaires, the results of which are collectively presented. The various types of collected media, such as texts, images, sound or video recordings, ensure a rich multimedia experience. The Discover graphical user interface (http://discover.mitwelten.org) allows the public to explore the collected research data using various selection criteria. The implemented functions are culturally established means such as maps for localization, calendar views for selecting the time span, or checkboxes for selecting topics. This classic approach served as a baseline for comparing the potential of artistic and more abstract forms of information transfer.

__Situation and ecological challenge__

People visit peri-urban recreation areas and nature reserves for a variety of reasons: to relax, observe nature, go for a walk, walk the dog, do sports, meet friends and much more. They are often not informed in depth about the different habitat types and their inhabitants and are also not aware of how much work goes into maintaining such areas. With the WalkApp, we tried to inform visitors on site and to involve them by context aware content presentation.

__Media-ecological approach__

A key feature of the WalkApp is that the Mitwelten datasets of the Reinacher Heide nature and recreation area are presented in the local outdoor context. Images, texts, infographics or sound documents are offered location-sensitively and thus context aware via a mobile device. A medial expanded walk should feel like you are on a walk with a biologist friend who occasionally points out interesting biological phenomena or sociopolitical conflicts. The eyes should not be constantly fixed on the mobile device so that the surrounding nature receives sufficient attention. Only when users approach a hotspot, they are alerted by a beep to a possibly interesting topic. The app also invites visitors of the Reinacher Heide to upload photos of their observations via the reporting platform WildeNachbarn. WalkApp users can choose from three different experience modes: ‘Living creatures and habitats’ informs with texts and images about the surrounding nature, ‘Points of View’ offers audio documents of expert interviews, and ‘Contributions of the Community’ displays uploaded visitor photos.

__Situation and ecological challenge__

It is difficult for humans to put themselves in the position of animals and plants, especially without anthropomorphizing their views. We have therefore explored a medium that allows the perspectives, needs and services of non-human actors in an ecosystem to be made more tangible. With the help of interactive 3D photography, immersive virtual spaces can be accessed and different viewpoints interconnected.

__Media-ecological approach__

Panorama is an exercise based on situated imagining of relations between various types of actors of an ecosystem. To get a better understanding of the different needs and services of people, animals, plants and things, we have selected a few key actors and analyzed their situations and correlations: e.g. a gardener, a lizard, a ﻿willow, a rubbish bin, or an ambient sensor. From the standpoint of such actors, 3D images were taken, and the relations to the other actors were made accessible through interactive links that lead to their 3D image spaces. The playful approach is thus used to open up a holistic ecological perspective and to sensitize people to the actors in the various habitats, promoting empathy. The medium allows the embedding of multimedia content such as text, photos, historical illustrations or audio clips from interviews and field recordings. Empirically collected and processed data sets can also be accessed in the spatial context and displayed in the form of PDFs.

__Situation and ecological challenge__

People are often unaware of the parallel worlds that coexist alongside their own. This is mainly due to the daily routine, lack of attention and understanding of the behaviors of non-human cohabitants, as well as humans' diurnal activity and limited night vision. Biological processes such as plant growth cannot be perceived either, as they are progressing too slow for our senses. The goal of WildCam TV was to develop a media format with unusual perspectives and time intervals that allows people to experience these hidden animal worlds and nature phenomena in a local context. 

__Media-ecological approach__

Wildlife cameras are frequently used by biologists to take pictures of wild animals to identify the present species of a habitat and their behaviors in order to derive conservation measures. For WildCam TV, we used recordings made as part of the ecosystem research of the Mitwelten project as footage: images of animals that were taken in hidden places as well as the pictures of plants taken for the Pollinator Diversity study. The interdisciplinary approach of the project allowed the use of these images that were stored in the database to be technically compiled and presented as an interactive, aesthetically appealing graphical user interface. The flip-book-like still image sequences are based on parametric selection criteria such as: camera, time period, day or night time, interval, and framerate and displayed in near real-time.
